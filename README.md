ChessMate is here to provide new chess players a more interactive learning experience.

## Setting up and using the Prototype

After grabbing the release, you can try out the prototype with the following steps:

### 1. Install Python 3.6 or higher

If **Python 3** is not already installed, you can install it from the [python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2. Run the program

The game logic can be tested out by using the provided sample program to move pieces around. This application allows you to view the state of the board and pick up pieces. When a piece is picked up, you can see what the valid moves for that piece are. Afterwards, you can set that piece back down.

To use the prototype, navigate to the `pi` directory and run the following command:

> `python console.py`
